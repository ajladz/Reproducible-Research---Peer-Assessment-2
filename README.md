## Impact of Weather Events on Public Health and the Economy of USA

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Man
severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a 
key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database 
tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as 
estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather event.
The questions that will be adressed in this data analysis are:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to 
population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
